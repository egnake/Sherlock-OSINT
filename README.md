> **The Ultimate Cloud-Based Username Enumeration & Intelligence Tool**

**Dijital Gölge** is a high-speed, open-source intelligence (OSINT) tool designed to track down usernames across **400+ social media platforms**. Unlike traditional tools, it operates with a **cloud-native database**, ensuring it never relies on outdated local files.

It goes beyond simple enumeration by generating **intelligence reports**, identifying potential data leaks via **Google Dorks**, and analyzing target footprints.

* **📝 Auto-Reporting:** Generates a detailed `.txt` report with all found profiles and timestamps.
* **🕵️ Google Dorking:** Automatically generates search queries to find leaked passwords, documents, or pastebin entries related to the target.
* **👻 Smart Detection:** Uses User-Agent rotation to bypass basic bot protection mechanisms.
